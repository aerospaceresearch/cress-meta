# Scripts for the analysis

Images gathered by the [cress.space](https://cress.space/) project are analysed with image processing and results plotted.
Some result plots can be found on [cress.space.machen.click](https://cress.space.machen.click/)

## egi.py

Compute the green coverage in the images. Currently an automatic threshold is used and later the invalid images (without green in them) deselected at plot time by setting `threshmin`.

    egi.py -T *.jpeg > cycleX.csv

## image series analysis

    speedseed.py -p "$(pwd)/" -m 23 -M 68 -s 39 -S 255 -v 29 -V 150  -o -5  -n 3 -d -g /path/to/*.jpeg
    # use script for threshholding and counting pixels
    egi.py -t 25 -g 1 -b 0 -r 0 *.stackthresh.png > threshold_percent.csv
    
## run_cycle_analysis.sh

This script runs the analysis scripts (egi.py, series analysis, see above) in each cycleX directory.

## greenplot.R

You can set these variables and then source the script to plot:

    threshmin=15 # range [0-255], not [%] as in plot
    csvfilename="path/to/cycle_x.csv"
    plottitle="Cress green coverage analysis"
    source("greenplot.R")
